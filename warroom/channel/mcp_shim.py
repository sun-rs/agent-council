"""MCP stdio server exposing channel tools to Claude Code / Codex CLI.

Wraps ChannelClient into 3 MCP tools:
  - channel_join(room)
  - channel_post(content, room, reply_to?)
  - channel_wait_new(room, timeout_s)

The shim maintains a single ChannelClient instance for its lifetime.
It connects to the broker on first tool call (lazy) and stays connected.

Two-phase bootstrap signal (v4 design):
  - On successful join: broadcasts system msg "<actor> joined <room>"
  - On first channel_wait_new call: broadcasts "<actor> listening"
    BEFORE blocking, so the viewer can confirm the agent entered the loop.

Usage:
    uv run python -m warroom.channel.mcp_shim \
        --actor claude --broker ws://127.0.0.1:9100

Registered in .mcp.json or via `codex mcp add`.
